<h2>Instructions</h2>

    <ol type="a">
        <li>Take softened butter, sugar, almond extract and vanilla in a stand mixer bowl. Attach the paddle attachment and beat it until it is light and fluffy.</li>
        <li>Add flour and salt. Run the mixer again until the dough comes together.</li>
        <li>Shape the dough into tablespoon-sized balls and place them on a cookie tray by spacing 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Make an indentation using a Â½ teaspoon measuring spoon.</li>
        <li>Fill the indentation of each cookie ball with jam. The jam will shrink as you bake so make sure to add enough.</li>
        <li>Now chill the cookie tray in the fridge for around 30 minutes. If you skip chilling the cookies balls then cookies will spread a lot more.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350F (180C) for at least 10 minutes. If needed line a baking sheet with parchment paper and keep it ready.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven for around 15-18 minutes or until lightly golden from the bottom. Let the shortbread thumbprint cookies cool in the pan itself for 5 minutes then transfer them to a cooling rack to cool down completely.</li>
    </ol>

<h2>Tips</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Always chill the shaped cookies and not the cookie dough. Making a neat indentation in the chill cookie ball is hard (impossible).</li>
        <li>Do not skip chilling the shaped cookies otherwise, they will spread too much in the oven while baking.</li>
        <li>Fill the jam right to the edge (or a slightly more) in the indentation as the jam will shrink or reduce during baking.</li>
        <li>For a variation, you can drizzle the icing sugar glaze on cooled cookies.</li>
        <li>Try other filling options than jam like Caramel, chocolate ganache, lemon curd, dulce de leche, and nutella.</li>
    </ul>
